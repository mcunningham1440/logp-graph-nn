Graph neural network to predict octanol-water partition coefficient

This is an early work-in-progress which I plan to make available as a Python package and/or a web server available via an AWS deployment when it is complete

The training dataset, `Final MFLOGP Dataset.csv`, is taken from ![this repo](https://github.com/TeixeiraResearchLab/MF-LOGP_Development-), which holds the code for the publication ![Dimensionally reduced machine learning model for predicting single component octanolâ€“water partition coefficients](https://jcheminf.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13321-022-00660-1)
